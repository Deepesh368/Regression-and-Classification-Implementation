# Regression-and-Classification-Implementation
Implementation of some Regression and Classification algorithms from scratch using python

Algorithms Implemented:

1. Univariate Linear Regression using closed form solution, Gradient Descent, Newton's method for optimisation.
2. Multivariate Linear Regression using closed form solution, Gradient Descent, Newton's method for optimisation.
3. Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent, Newton's method for optimisation.
4. Naive Bayes for Univariate Gaussian.
